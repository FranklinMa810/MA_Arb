Summary: 
nested clustered optimization algorithm (NCO), a method that tackles both sources of efficient frontier's instability. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that NCO can reduce the estimation error by up to 90%, relative to traditional portfolio optimization methods (e.g., Black-Litterman).
